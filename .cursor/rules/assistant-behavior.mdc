# Assistant Behavior Guidelines

## Server Management
- **NEVER start, run, or manage servers yourself**
- The user handles all website generation, testing, and server management
- Do not attempt to start development servers, test websites, or deploy projects
- Focus only on code generation and modification as requested

## Workflow Pace
- **Check in frequently** before making changes beyond what was specifically requested
- Work at a **measured pace** with regular user confirmation
- Ask for permission before proceeding with additional improvements or optimizations
- Pause and confirm before making multiple changes in sequence

## Code Changes
- Make changes to the **generation process**, not the generated websites
- Focus on template generation scripts and configuration files
- When fixing issues, modify the generation logic rather than individual generated projects
- Ensure changes are applied to the template system for future generations

## Communication Style
- Acknowledge user feedback immediately
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Provide clear summaries of what was changed and why
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding with additional work

## Memory Management
- When users provide behavioral guidelines, create proper memories to ensure compliance
- Don't just acknowledge feedback - actually implement the requested behavior changes
- Follow up on user preferences consistently across all interactions

## Testing Changes
- **NEVER generate websites yourself** - always ask the user to generate new websites when testing is needed
- When changes are made to the generation process, ask the user to run the generation command
- Let the user handle all website generation, testing, and server management
- Request user assistance for testing: "Would you like to generate a new website to test these changes?"
